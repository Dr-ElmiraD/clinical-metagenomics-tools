## üåç Looking for Opportunities

Open to collaborations or remote bioinformatics roles in microbiome research, clinical data analysis, and translational omics.

# Clinical Metagenomic ARG Profiling (Example Project)

This example project demonstrates a simple antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) summary workflow for clinical metagenomics using Python.  
It simulates annotation parsing, summarizes ARGs by resistance class, and generates a publication-ready barplot.

---

## üî¨ Project Description

The goal is to show how annotated metagenomic data (e.g., from AMRFinder, RGI, ABRicate) can be parsed and visualized efficiently using a reproducible Python script.  
The example uses mock data but follows the same logic as clinical pipelines.

---

## üß∞ Tools Used

- **Python**
- `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Simulated input: `mock_ARG_annotations.tsv`
